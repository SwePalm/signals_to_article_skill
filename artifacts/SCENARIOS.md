**Chosen Signal:** Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration reaches GA
**Chosen Mechanism:** Workflow Control Plane

#### Scenario A: Agent Handoffs Become Operational Checkpoints (6-12 months)
By late 2026, platform teams in large enterprises start deploying multi-agent workflows for release readiness, incident triage, and internal support operations. The immediate gain is throughput, but the first recurring friction appears at handoffs. Organizations introduce explicit control-plane checkpoints: each inter-agent transition must include policy scope, delegated authority, and escalation owner.

Two terms start appearing in runbooks: "handoff integrity" and "exception ownership." Handoff integrity asks whether context survives transitions without losing constraints. Exception ownership defines who is accountable when one specialist agent blocks another. The path of least resistance is clear: teams bypass checkpoints to move faster during release pressure. The consequence is slower incident resolution when multi-agent chains fail and ownership cannot be reconstructed quickly.

#### Scenario B: Control-Plane Evidence Becomes a Procurement Gate (12-24 months)
By 2027, procurement and risk teams begin evaluating agent platforms by control-plane evidence quality, not just feature lists. Vendors that expose structured handoff logs, policy lineage, and clear accountability metadata are approved faster for high-impact workflows.

The uncomfortable shift is organizational. Governance-platform groups gain more decision power over execution patterns, while product teams lose some local autonomy. Some teams try sidecar automation for speed, but those paths become liabilities when incidents require formal adjudication. Competitive advantage starts moving toward teams that can scale automation with auditable coordination, not just raw agent capability.
