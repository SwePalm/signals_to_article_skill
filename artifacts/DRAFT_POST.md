While everyone is obsessing over agentic productivity, a new wave of "Verification-as-a-Service" (VaaS) startups is silently building the real infrastructure of the 2026 economy.

This isn’t just another security feature. We are witnessing a fundamental shift in **Trust Infrastructure**. We are moving from "Trust but Verify"—where humans audit logs after the fact—to "Verification as a Control Plane," where agents cannot execute without cryptographically signed permission from an independent auditor.

Imagine a near future where your enterprise procurement agents are in complete deadlock. A high-stakes deal stalls for 15 minutes because your profit-optimizing agent and your compliance-auditor agent are bickering over the semantic interpretation of a new regulatory update. You aren’t managing work anymore; you are arbitrating between competing machine logics.

The strategic implication is clear: in an era of infinite, cheap AI generation, the competitive moat is **Verifiable Correctness**. Value is accruing away from execution and toward the independent verification layers. If you can’t prove *why* your agent made a decision in real-time, you are a liability, not an asset.

This is not a prediction.

As agents move from "suggesting" to "deciding," who is auditing the auditors in your organization?
