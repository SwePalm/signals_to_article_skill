Most enterprise AI discussions still reward feature velocity.

In the next 6-12 months, the harder differentiator will be control-plane accountability: can you prove who handed what to whom across agent chains, under which policy constraints?

Recent platform releases point in the same direction. Multi-agent capability is moving into production, and browser/action execution is being consolidated into broader agent runtimes. That is a structural shift in the workflow layer.

Teams will bypass checkpoint controls for speed when deadlines tighten. That works until one cross-agent incident requires ownership adjudication and no one can reconstruct the handoff lineage quickly.

The strategic implication is practical. Organizations with stronger identity + policy + handoff evidence pipelines will scale automation sooner because they can delegate more work without creating opaque failure modes.

This is not a prediction.

If a critical workflow failed this quarter, could your team prove accountability at every agent handoff?
