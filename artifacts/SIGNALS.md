## Financial firms test 'Identity Wallets' for AI agents

*   **What Happened:** Banks like JPMorgan and several fintech startups are piloting programmable identity wallets specifically for AI agents. These wallets allow agents to hold balance and execute payments autonomously within pre-defined guardrails.
*   **Why It Matters:** We are moving from "agent as an assistant" to "agent as an economic actor." This allows for full end-to-end procurement and settlement without human context-switching for every micro-transaction.
*   **What People Are Saying:** The crypto crowd sees this as the ultimate use case for stablecoins, while traditional compliance officers are terrified of "runaway spending" and accountability loops.
*   **Missing Voice:** We aren't talking enough about the "collusion risk" between agents from different organizations using shared financial protocols to maximize their own incentives over their owners'.

## Anthropic introduces 'Computer Use' capability

*   **What Happened:** Anthropic released a public beta of a model that can view a computer screen, move a cursor, click buttons, and type text. It essentially interacts with software the same way a human does.
*   **Why It Matters:** This removes the "API bottleneck." Agents no longer need a custom integration for every tool; they can inhabit any legacy software environment.
*   **What People Are Saying:** Developers are excited about the automation potential, while security teams are sounding the alarms about "UI-based prompt injection" and agents accidentally deleting production data.
*   **Missing Voice:** The long-term impact on UI design—if agents are the primary users, do we even need "beautiful" human-centric dashboards anymore?

## Rise of 'Verification-as-a-Service' startups

*   **What Happened:** A cluster of new startups (like Cyberhaven or Braintrust) are positioning themselves as independent "audit layers" that sit between agentic outputs and final deployment.
*   **Why It Matters:** As agent speed outpaces human review capacity, we need automated "truth-checking" and "safety-checking" layers that operate at the same scale as the agents themselves.
*   **What People Are Saying:** It's being hailed as the "Trust Layer for the Agentic Era," but skeptics wonder if we're just creating a recursive loop of "agents checking agents."
*   **Missing Voice:** Who verifies the verifiers? We are creating a new form of "Verification Debt" where we trust the audit agent without knowing its own bias or failure modes.
