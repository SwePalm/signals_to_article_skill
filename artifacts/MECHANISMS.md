# Mechanism Map

**Signal:** Financial firms test 'Identity Wallets' for AI agents
*   **Mechanism 1: Identity & Accountability** - Shift from human-bound identity (KYC) to agent-bound cryptographic identity (KBA - Know Your Agent), allowing for granular, non-human accountability.
*   **Mechanism 2: Pricing & Budgeting** - Transition from department-level budgets to micro-budgeting where agents carry their own digital wallets, enabling real-time, high-frequency resource allocation.
*   **Mechanism 3: Procurement** - Moving from human-negotiated multi-year contracts to machine-negotiated, event-driven procurement with instant settlement.

**Signal:** Anthropic introduces 'Computer Use' capability
*   **Mechanism 1: Workflow Control Plane** - Shifting control of business logic from rigid, hard-coded API integrations to fluid, vision-based manipulation of legacy UI layers.
*   **Mechanism 2: Coordination** - Enabling agents to act as "glue" between disconnected SaaS silos by physically (virtually) moving data and context where APIs do not exist.
*   **Mechanism 3: Verification & Audit** - New requirement for state-level verification of UI actions (did the agent click the right button for the right reason?) rather than simple payload validation.

**Signal:** Rise of 'Verification-as-a-Service' startups
*   **Mechanism 1: Trust Infrastructure** - The emergence of a "Meta-Verification" layer that decouples execution (the agent doing work) from safety (the auditor checking work), creating a competitive market for trust.
*   **Mechanism 2: Verification & Audit** - Transition from periodic, human-led audits to continuous, agentic "Shadow Validation" that monitors every token and action in real-world environments.
*   **Mechanism 3: Market Design** - Creation of a secondary market for "Proof of Correctness," where organizations pay for the certainty that their autonomous fleets remain within policy bounds.
