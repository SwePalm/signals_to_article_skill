- **Clarity Critic:** "Control-plane accountability" is clear; keep one plain-language example (policy scope + escalation owner).
- **Skeptic Critic:** Good acknowledgment of bypass behavior; keep the consequence concrete (slower adjudication/recovery).
- **Credibility Guard:** Claims are grounded in operational mechanics and procurement behavior, not hype language.
- **Structure Guard:** Flow and disclaimer are present; timeline is correctly anchored in 6-12 months.
