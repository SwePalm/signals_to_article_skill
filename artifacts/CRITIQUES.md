# Critiques

**H1: Clarity Critic**
*   "Verification Gridlock" is a strong concept, but the "15 minutes" example feels a bit arbitrary. To make it clearer, relate the delay to a tangible business consequence—like losing a slot in a fast-moving logistics chain.
*   The phrase "Value is accruing away from execution" is dense. It would be clearer to say "Profit margins are shifting from *doing* the work to *verifying* the work."

**H2: Skeptic Critic**
*   Why would an enterprise allow an independent agent to stall a deal for 15 minutes? Real-world high-frequency systems would have bypasses. The scenario needs to explain why the audit *cannot* be bypassed (e.g., legal liability or immutable smart contract constraints).
*   Is "VaaS" really distinct from cybersecurity? Make sure to distinguish why this is a new category (behavioral audit vs. technical vulnerability).

**H3: Credibility Guard**
*   "Infrastructure of the 2026 economy" sounds slightly overblown. Maybe "an essential governance layer for the 2026 agentic roadmap."
*   Avoid the "silently building" trope; these startups are actually quite vocal about their funding rounds. Focus instead on the "under-discussed" nature of the shift.

**H4: Structure Guard**
*   Structure is perfectly followed.
*   Disclaimer "This is not a prediction" is correctly placed.
*   The closing question is hard and open-ended.
