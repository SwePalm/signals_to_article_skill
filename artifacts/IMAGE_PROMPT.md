Photorealistic 35mm cinematic scene in an enterprise release-operations room during daytime. A platform engineer, release manager, and risk analyst stand around a large monitor showing a multi-agent workflow timeline with visible handoff checkpoints, policy scope fields, and escalation owners. One handoff is flagged red with missing ownership and the team is actively triaging. Natural business attire, realistic office materials, laptops, printed runbook, sticky notes, and calm but focused expressions. Documentary realism, subtle moody lighting, high texture detail, no futuristic holograms, no robot imagery, no abstract symbols.
