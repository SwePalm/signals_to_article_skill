While everyone is tracking agentic productivity, a new governance layer for the 2026 roadmap is being built in plain sight: **Verification-as-a-Service (VaaS).**

This isn’t just improved cybersecurity. We are witnessing a fundamental shift in **Trust Infrastructure**. We are moving from "Trust but Verify"—where humans audit logs after the fact—to a world where agents are compliance-locked. They simply cannot execute without a real-time, cryptographic "Stamp of Compliance" from an independent auditor agent.

Imagine a near-future scenario: Your automated procurement agent is in a deadlock. A high-stakes deal with a key supplier stalls—not because of the price, but because your auditor agent has flagged a semantic misalignment in a new regulatory update. You miss your logistics slot while two machine logics bicker over a sub-clause. You aren't managing work anymore; you are arbitrating between competing autonomous interpretations of policy.

The strategic shift is tectonic: Profit margins are moving from *execution* (doing the work) to *verification* (proving the work stayed within bounds). In an era of infinite, cheap AI generation, the ultimate competitive moat is **Verifiable Correctness.**

This is not a prediction.

As your agents move from "suggesting" to "deciding," who is auditing the auditors in your organization?
