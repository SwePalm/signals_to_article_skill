Most enterprise AI conversations still reward feature velocity.

Over the next 6-12 months, the practical differentiator will be control-plane accountability: who delegated each agent action, under what policy scope, and with which escalation owner.

Recent platform moves make this visible. Multi-agent orchestration is now production-grade, and browser/action execution is being folded into broader agent runtimes. The system boundary is shifting from "can it do the task" to "can we adjudicate the handoff."

This is where teams will feel friction first. Under delivery pressure, some groups will bypass checkpoints for speed. That works until a cross-agent incident hits and no one can reconstruct ownership fast enough. Recovery slows. Trust drops.

The near-term implication is operational, not theoretical. Teams with stronger identity + policy + handoff-evidence pipelines will expand automation faster because they can delegate more without losing control.

This is not a prediction.

If a critical workflow failed this quarter, could your organization prove accountability at every agent handoff?
