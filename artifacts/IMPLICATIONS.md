**Operational:**
- Multi-agent deployments will require explicit checkpoint controls in day-to-day workflows within 6-12 months.
- Incident response will depend on structured handoff evidence, not just service logs.
- Bypass paths will improve local speed but increase system-wide recovery time.

**Organizational:**
- Platform governance and release operations gain authority over execution policy design.
- Product teams trade ad hoc autonomy for clearer escalation and accountability paths.
- Audit and risk functions move earlier into workflow architecture decisions.

**Strategic:**
- Near-term differentiation comes from scalable control planes, not model access alone.
- Procurement decisions increasingly reward verifiable accountability metadata.
- Organizations that operationalize accountable delegation can expand automation scope faster.
