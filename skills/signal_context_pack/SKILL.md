# Signal Context Pack

**Goal:** Create a `SIGNALS.md` artifact with context for each of the top 3 signals.

## Instructions
1.  **Input:** Top 3 ranked signals.
2.  **Action:** For each signal, write a "Context Pack" using your LLM capabilities.
3.  **Format per Signal:**
    *   **## Signal Name**
    *   **What Happened:** (2-3 sentences expanding on the summary)
    *   **Why It Matters:** (The "So What?" - immediate impact)
    *   **What People Are Saying:** (Simulated vibe of the discourse)
    *   **Missing Voice:** (What aspect is being ignored?)

## Deliverable
Write all 3 context packs into a single file: `artifacts/SIGNALS.md`
