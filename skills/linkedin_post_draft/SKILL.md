# LinkedIn Post Draft

**Goal:** Write a compelling, high-signal LinkedIn post.

## Instructions
1.  **Input:**
    *   `artifacts/SIGNALS.md` (The "What")
    *   `artifacts/MECHANISMS.md` (The "How")
    *   `artifacts/SCENARIOS.md` (The "Where")
    *   `artifacts/IMPLICATIONS.md` (The "So What")

2.  **Structure:**
    *   **Hook:** Choose one of these structural templates:
        *   *The "Quiet Build":* "While the market is distracted by [Trend X], the real infrastructure for [Trend Y] is being built in plain sight."
        *   *The "Semantic Shift":* "We are moving from a world of [Concept A] to a world of [Concept B]. The bridge is [Mechanism]."
        *   *The "Operational Deadlock":* "Imagine your best [Role] stalling because of [Specific Technical Friction]. This is the [Theme] problem."
    *   **Mechanism:** Explain the structural shift. Avoid "not just a feature"—use "fundamental change in [System Layer]."
    *   **Scenario:** Briefly paint the picture of the Near Future scenario. Focus on the *drift* or *governance* aspect.
    *   **Implication:** Hit the hardest Strategic implication.
    *   **Disclaimer:** Must include the exact sentence: "This is not a prediction."
    *   **Closing:** End with a hard, open-ended question for the reader.

3.  **Rhetorical Constraints:**
    *   **NO AI-isms:** Avoid "tapestry," "delve," "landscape," "ever-evolving," "leverage."
    *   **Sentence Length:** Vary sentence length. Use short, punchy statements for emphasis.
    *   **Persona:** Speak as a Lead Architect, not a marketing copywriter. Use technical nouns over marketing adjectives.
    *   Short paragraphs (max 3 lines).

## Deliverable
Write the draft to `artifacts/DRAFT_POST.md`.
