# Mechanism Map

**Goal:** Identify the structural change driving the signal.

## Instructions
1.  **Input:** Read `artifacts/SIGNALS.md`.
2.  **Action:** For each of the top 3 signals, identify 2-4 "Candidate Mechanisms".
    *   *Definition:* A mechanism is a specific system function that is changing (e.g., "From centralized audit to decentralized verification").
3.  **Force Mechanism Types:**
    *   Trust Infrastructure
    *   Coordination
    *   Identity/Accountability
    *   Market Design
    *   Pricing/Budgeting
    *   Workflow Control Plane
    *   Verification & Audit
    *   Procurement

## Deliverable
Write to `artifacts/MECHANISMS.md`.

### Format per Signal
**Signal:** [Signal Name]
*   **Mechanism 1:** [Name] - [Brief explanation of the structural change]
*   **Mechanism 2:** [Name] - [Brief explanation]
