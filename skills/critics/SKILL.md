# Critics

**Goal:** Stress-test the draft before publication.

## Instructions
1.  **Input:** Read `artifacts/DRAFT_POST.md`.
2.  **Action:** Adopt four distinct personas and critique the draft.

## Personas
1.  **H1: Clarity Critic:** "Is this jargon? Would a smart 15-year-old understand the core conflict?"
    *   *Anti-Goal:* Flag any term that obscures the actual mechanism instead of explaining it.
2.  **H2: Skeptic Critic:** "Why is this wrong? What if the opposite happens? Where is the evidence?"
    *   *Anti-Goal:* Look for "high-frequency bypasses"—identify where a business would simply ignore the governance for speed, and force the draft to explain why they *can't*.
3.  **H3: Credibility Guard:** "Does this sound like 'thought leader' fluff? Are we overclaiming?" 
    *   *Anti-Goal:* Kill all "vague optimism." Replace with "specific operational reality." If it sounds like a LinkedIn template, it's wrong.
4.  **H4: Structure Guard:** "Does it follow the Hook -> Mechanism -> Scenario -> Implication flow? Did they include the disclaimer? Is the timeline anchored in 6-12 months?"

## Deliverable
Write a bulleted list of critiques to `artifacts/CRITIQUES.md`.
