# Implication Synthesizer

**Goal:** Turn "what might happen" (scenarios) into "what it means for us" (implications).

## Instructions
1.  **Input:** Read `artifacts/SCENARIOS.md`.
2.  **Action: Synthesis**
    *   Analyze the two scenarios and synthesize a unified set of implications.
    *   **Techno-Economic Lens:** Specifically look for shifts in profit margins (e.g., value moving from execution to verification) and technical moats (e.g., ZK-proofs, immutable logs).
    *   **Validation Step:** For each implication, ask: "Is this just a restatement of the scenario, or is it a *consequence* of the scenario?" Only keep the consequences.

## Layers
1.  **Operational Layer:** What breaks in our daily workflows? What tools become obsolete? What new friction appears?
2.  **Organizational Layer:** What roles change? Who gains power? Who loses it? What new departments form?
3.  **Strategic Layer:** What new capabilities become defensible? What is the new "moat"? Where is the value accruing?

## Deliverable
Write to `artifacts/IMPLICATIONS.md`.

### Format
**Operational:**
*   [Point 1]
*   [Point 2]

**Organizational:**
*   [Point 1]
*   [Point 2]

**Strategic:**
*   [Point 1]
*   [Point 2]
